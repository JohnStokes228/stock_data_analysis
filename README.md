# stock_data_analysis

A piece of analysis and prehaps some ML based on some stock data a friend web scraped. Might also look to join it with further, third party datasources if possible and just generally see what i can come up with. I dont even know what features the data has atm tbh so its quite dependent on that but would be nice to see if we could build some kind of more elaborate data visualisations if possible. Not sure if I'd go ahead with any learning algorhythms or not yet but keep the door open justi n case i guess lol
